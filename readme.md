### Dependencies
  - python==3.8
  - pandas==1.5.3
  - matplotlib==3.7.1
  - scipy==1.10.1
  - hdbscan==0.8.29
  - opencv==4.6.0
  - scikit-learn==1.2.2
  - umap-learn==0.5.3
### Usage
#### Installation
SEMORE's installation guide utilize conda environment setup, therefore either miniconda or anaconda is required to follow the bellow installation guide.
 - Anaconda install guide: [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
 - Mini conda install guide: [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

SEMORE is most easily setup in a new conda environment with dependecies and channels found in dependency.yml - Open Terminal / Commando promt at whished location of SEMORE and run the bash commands below, which creates the environemnt, downloades and installs packages, takes 9m 35s. Run time for regular csv files of <50MB is expected below 10 minutes. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hatzakislab/SEMORE
cd SEMORE
conda env create -f dependency.yml
conda activate SEMORE
```
SEMORE modules and additional/helpful functions are contained in the `Scripts` folder.
SEMORE modules are imported as:
```python
from Scripts.SEMORE_clustering import find_clust
from Scripts.SEMORE_fingerprint import Morphology_fingerprint
```
Three test python scripts are provided:
  - `Data_sim_test.py` - test data generation.
  - `Segmentation_test.py` - test the clustering module on simulated data.
  - `Fingerprint_test.py` - test the fingerprint modules on the resulting data from Segmentation_test.py.
### Own data
`SEMORE_clustering.find_clust` accepts 2-D localizations containing a temporal element [x,y,t] while `SEMORE_fingerprint.Morphology_fingerprint` accepts localizations [x,y] both static and temporal resolved. The output of the fingerprintg can then freely be used for further analysis.

### For demostration
For demostration regarding presented data contained in the manuscript, please refer to the `_For_puplicaiton` folder where you will find the required information and scripts.
