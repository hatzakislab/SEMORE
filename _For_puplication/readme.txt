This folder contains the complete data and results used and expressed in the manuscript. 
All the preprocessing has been done, but are avaible for additional runs if required. 
All scripts should be plug and play given you have these additional modules

    - seaborn == 0.12.2
    - tqdm == 4.65

The scripts are contained in the folder called Programs/Figures.
In each script there is a small note/string explaining the script.

the following run times are close to:
    - 90 min for total simulation segmentation
    - 30 min for total simulations fingerprint
    - 8 min for insulin segmentation
    - 6 min for insulin fingerprinting
    - 30 sec for NPC fingerprinting

The reuslting output of these scripts are results or plots alike seen in the manuscript.
